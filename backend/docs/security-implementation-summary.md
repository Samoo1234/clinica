**Key Methods:**
- `encrypt(plaintext)` / `decrypt(encryptedData)` - General encryption
- `encryptCPF(cpf)` / `decryptCPF(encryptedCPF)` - CPF-specific encryption
- `encryptPhone(phone)` / `decryptPhone(encryptedPhone)` - Phone-specific encryption

- **Sensitive data access logging** with field-level tracking
- **Data export monitoring** with metadata
- **Security alert generation** based on audit patterns
- **Automatic log cleanup** for LGPD compliance

**Key Features:**
- User action tracking with IP address and user agent
- Resource-specific logging (patients, medical records, etc.)
- Metadata support for additional context
- Query capabilities with filtering and pagination

### 3. Security Monitoring Service (`SecurityMonitoringService`)
- **Real-time threat detection** with configurable thresholds
- **Multiple failed login detection** by IP and user
- **Unusual data access pattern detection**
- **Off-hours login monitoring**
- **Excessive API usage detection**
- **Data export monitoring**
- **Security metrics dashboard**

**Alert Types:**
- `MULTIPLE_FAILED_LOGINS_IP` - Multiple failed logins from same IP
- `MULTIPLE_FAILED_LOGINS_USER` - Multiple failed logins for same user
- `UNUSUAL_DATA_ACCESS` - Excessive sensitive data access
- `UNUSUAL_LOGIN_TIME` - Logins during unusual hours (10 PM - 5 AM)
- `EXCESSIVE_API_USAGE` - High API call volume
- `EXCESSIVE_DATA_EXPORTS` - Multiple data exports

### 4. LGPD Compliance Service (`LGPDComplianceService`)
- **Data retention policies** with automatic enforcement
- **Data anonymization** for old records
- **Data subject access requests** (Right to Access)
- **Data erasure requests** (Right to be Forgotten)
- **Automatic data cleanup** based on retention periods

**Retention Policies:**
- Audit logs: 7 years (2555 days)
- Medical records: 20 years with anonymization after 15 years
- Appointments: 5 years with anonymization after 3 years
- Financial records: 5 years
- Integration logs: 1 year

### 5. Backup Service (`BackupService`)
- **Full and incremental backups** with compression and encryption
- **Automated backup scheduling** (daily incremental, weekly full)
- **Backup integrity verification** with checksums
- **Encrypted backup storage** with key management
- **Backup restoration capabilities**
- **Automatic cleanup** of old backups

**Backup Types:**
- **Full Backup**: Complete database dump
- **Incremental Backup**: Only changed data since last backup
- **Compressed**: GZIP compression for storage efficiency
- **Encrypted**: AES encryption for backup files

### 6. Database Schema
- **Security-specific tables** for audit logs, alerts, and backup tracking
- **LGPD compliance tables** for data subject requests
- **Proper indexing** for performance optimization
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for data access control
- **Automated functions** for cleanup and monitoring

**New Tables:**
- `audit_logs` - System audit trail
- `security_alerts` - Security monitoring alerts
- `data_subject_requests` - LGPD compliance requests
- `backup_logs` - Backup operation tracking

### 7. API Endpoints
- **Security metrics** - `/api/security/security-metrics`
- **Security alerts** - `/api/security/security-alerts`
- **Audit logs** - `/api/security/audit-logs`
- **Backup management** - `/api/security/backups/*`
- **LGPD compliance** - `/api/security/data-subject-requests/*`
- **Encryption utilities** - `/api/security/encrypt-data`, `/api/security/decrypt-data`

### 8. Frontend Security Management
- **Security dashboard** with real-time metrics
- **Alert management** interface for security team
- **Audit log viewer** with filtering capabilities
- **Backup management** with creation and restoration
- **LGPD compliance tools** for data subject requests

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key

# Backup Storage
BACKUP_STORAGE_PATH=./backups

# Email for notifications (optional)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Database Setup
1. Run the main schema: `backend/database/schema.sql`
2. Run the security schema: `backend/database/security-schema.sql`
3. Run the security setup: `backend/database/setup-security.sql`

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- CPF and phone numbers have specialized encryption
- Passwords properly hashed with salt
- Secure token generation for sessions

### 2. Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Admin-only access to security features
- Audit trail for all data access

### 3. Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time security monitoring
- Automated threat detection
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Security metrics dashboard

### 4. Compliance
- LGPD compliance features
- Data retention policies
- Right to access and erasure
- Audit trail for compliance

### 5. Business Continuity
- Automated backup system
- Encrypted backup storage
- Backup integrity verification
- Disaster recovery capabilities

## Testing

### Unit Tests
