# Medical Records API Documentation

## Overview

The Medical Records API provides comprehensive functionality for managing medical records in the VisionCare ophthalmology clinic system. It includes CRUD operations, file attachments, search capabilities, and specialized features for ophthalmology data.

## Features Implemented

### 1. CRUD Operations using Supabase Client
- ✅ Create medical records with ophthalmology-specific structure
- ✅ Read medical records by ID, patient ID, or doctor ID
- ✅ Update medical records with partial data
- ✅ Delete medical records with proper cleanup

### 2. Ophthalmology-Specific Data Structure
- ✅ Physical exam JSON structure with:
  - Visual acuity (right/left eye)
  - Intraocular pressure (right/left eye)
  - Fundoscopy findings
  - Biomicroscopy findings
  - Extensible for additional custom fields

### 3. File Upload using Supabase Storage
- ✅ Upload attachments to medical records
- ✅ Support for multiple file types (images, PDFs, Word documents)
- ✅ File size validation (10MB limit)
- ✅ Secure file storage with signed URLs
- ✅ File cleanup on deletion

### 4. Chronological Ordering and Queries
- ✅ Get medical records with chronological ordering (ASC/DESC)
- ✅ Pagination support for large datasets
- ✅ Date range filtering for doctor queries
- ✅ Optimized database queries with proper indexing

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for all API endpoints
- ✅ Service layer testing
- ✅ Error handling validation
- ✅ File upload testing
- ✅ Integration test structure

## API Endpoints

### Medical Records
- `POST /api/medical-records` - Create new medical record
- `GET /api/medical-records/:id` - Get medical record by ID
- `GET /api/medical-records/patient/:patientId` - Get records by patient
- `GET /api/medical-records/doctor/:doctorId` - Get records by doctor
- `PUT /api/medical-records/:id` - Update medical record
- `DELETE /api/medical-records/:id` - Delete medical record

### Attachments
- `POST /api/medical-records/:id/attachments` - Upload attachment
- `GET /api/medical-records/:id/attachments` - Get attachments list
- `GET /api/medical-records/attachments/:id/download` - Get download URL
- `DELETE /api/medical-records/attachments/:id` - Delete attachment

### Search and Statistics
- `GET /api/medical-records/search/:query` - Search records
- `GET /api/medical-records/patient/:patientId/stats` - Patient statistics

## Data Models

### Medical Record Structure
```typescript
interface MedicalRecord {
  id: string
  patient_id: string
  doctor_id: string
  consultation_date: string
  chief_complaint?: string
  anamnesis?: string
  physical_exam: PhysicalExam
  diagnosis?: string
  prescription?: string
  follow_up_date?: string
  created_at: string
  updated_at: string
}
```

### Ophthalmology Physical Exam
```typescript
interface PhysicalExam {
  visualAcuity?: {
    rightEye: string
    leftEye: string
  }
  intraocularPressure?: {
    rightEye: number
    leftEye: number
  }
  fundoscopy?: string
  biomicroscopy?: string
  [key: string]: any // Extensible for custom fields
}
```

## Security Features

- ✅ JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- ✅ File type validation for uploads
- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Secure signed URLs for file access
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

## Storage Configuration

### Supabase Storage Bucket
- Bucket name: `attachments`
- Private bucket (not publicly accessible)
- File size limit: 10MB
- Allowed file types:
  - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF
  - Documents: PDF, Word (.doc, .docx)

### RLS Policies
- Users can only upload attachments to their own records
- Users can only view attachments they have access to
- Proper cleanup on record deletion

## Frontend Integration

### Service Layer
- ✅ Complete TypeScript service (`medicalRecordsService`)
- ✅ Type-safe API calls
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ File upload support
- ✅ Helper methods for data formatting

### Features Available
- Create and manage medical records
- Upload and manage attachments
- Search medical records
- View patient statistics
- Chronological record viewing

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (18 tests)
- API endpoint testing
- Service layer validation
- Error handling scenarios
- File upload validation
- Data structure validation

### Integration Tests
- Database connection testing
- Supabase integration validation
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation fulfills all requirements from the specification:

- **Requirement 2.1**: ✅ Complete medical record history in chronological order
- **Requirement 2.2**: ✅ Structured forms for ophthalmology consultations
- **Requirement 2.3**: ✅ Automatic registration of date, time, and professional
- **Requirement 2.4**: ✅ File attachment support for exams and images
- **Requirement 2.5**: ✅ Medical history summary display

## Next Steps

The medical records API is fully implemented and ready for frontend integration. The next task would be to implement the frontend interface for medical records management (Task 8 in the implementation plan).
